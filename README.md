## Finding-Donors-Project
# Summary of results and process:
- Achieved a accuracy score of 84.60% and F-score of 70.17% on the testing data.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the nature of raw data.
- Performed Data-Preprocessing by implementing feature scaling & one-hot encoding for the feature
& target data.
- Implemented a data pipeline that will train and predict using random-forests, support vector machines(SVM), and KNN supervised learning algorithms. 
- Defined important metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-score to evaluate the performance of above mentioned machine learning models and choose a model to work with appropriately.
- Performed model tuning using grid search for the final chosen model.


# Description
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
